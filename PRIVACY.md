CELLSCANNER
===========

Cellscanner is an Android application to collect network and location data from your cell phone.

Purpose of Cellscanner
----------------------

The purpose of Cellscanner is to improve the legal system. It is developed by the Netherlands
Forensic Institute (NFI), one of the world's leading forensic laboratories. Its activities include
forensic interpretation of location traces from cell phones. To be able to understand what may have
happened in a criminal investigation, it is important to know how mobile networks behave under
different circumstances. To learn how these networks operate, and how to interpret their traces in
criminal cases, we need data from ordinary users. We will use these data to derive aggregated
statistics. We will never attempt to reveal the identity of individual users. An example of the type
of research done with similar data in the past can be found here:
[10.1016/j.scijus.2019.10.005](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.scijus.2019.10.005).

Data collection
---------------

When activated, Cellscanner logs two types of location data: addresses of **cell towers** the device
connects to, and optionally **GPS coordinates** along with other GPS data such as their accuracy.
Cellscanner only collects what is strictly necessary to achieve its goal. That includes network and
(optionally) GPS data. Network data may reveal the coarse location of the device, depending on the
number of cell towers in the area. In addition, a device identifier is stored. This identifier is
used to link different submissions of data from the same user, and is generated randomly, once after
the app is installed.

Optionally, these data are sent manually or automatically to the NFI or, alternatively, to a third
party if the user chooses to change the upload settings. Data submitted to the NFI may be used and
stored up to a maximum of 30 years after submission, after which they will be deleted.

User control
------------

As a user, you control how and when data are collected. You may enable or disable recording at any
time using the switch button on the main screen. In addition, GPS logging is optional and can be
enabled or disabled as well. When the app is recording and GPS logging is disabled, only cell tower
addresses are registered. The user may also configure if and how data are uploaded.

User consent
------------

By using this app, you indicate that you understand and consent to the above. If you wish to revoke
your consent, and have your already uploaded data removed from NFI servers, you can delete the app
and email your deletion request to [fbda@nfi.nl](mailto:fbda@nfi.nl). In this email you should
mention the name of this app (Cellscanner) and your device identifier, which is shown below. This
identifier is the only link between you and your data. We recommend that you write it down, in case
you may wish to revoke your consent later.

In summary, by using this app you consent and understand that:

- the data collected by this app are stored locally on your device;
- these data are securely uploaded to and stored on NFI servers when you enable the upload feature;
- these data are used by NFI as described above;
- these data are retained by NFI for a maximum of 30 years;
- you may revoke your consent at any time.
